# Weather Server Learning Project

This is a simple Weather Server project built for educational purposes. It is a great project for students who are learning to build web applications using Express.js and interacting with public APIs.

## Installation

1. Firstly, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. If you do not have these installed already, you can install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

## Usage

This server is very straightforward to use.

1. Start the server by running:

   ```
   node app.js
   ```

2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` on your browser.

3. Enter the name of the city you want to get the weather of, and click on "Search" button.

The server will send a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather information and display the result on the page.
