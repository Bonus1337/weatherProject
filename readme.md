# Weather Server Learning Project

This is a simple Weather Server project built for educational purposes. It is a great project for students who are learning to build web applications using Express.js and interacting with public APIs.

## Installation

Follow the below instructions for setting up this project locally.

1. Firstly, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. If you do not have these installed already, you can install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Bonus1337/weatherProject.git
   ```

3. Navigate to your project folder, and install the required dependencies:
   ```
   cd weatherProject
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

This server is very straightforward to use.

1. Start the server by running:

   ```
   node app.js
   ```

2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` on your browser.

3. Enter the name of the city you want to get the weather of, and click on "Search" button.

The server will send a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather information and display the result on the page.
